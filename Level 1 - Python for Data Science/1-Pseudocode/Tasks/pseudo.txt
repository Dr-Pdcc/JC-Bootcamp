1. An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly
until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the
largest of the numbers that were input.

Proposed pseudocode:

set largest_number to zero (to store the largest number entered by the user)
repeat:
 request a positive number from the user
 if user input is greater than largest_number
	assign user input to largest_number
until user input is equal to zero
print the final value of largest_number

2.An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.

Proposed pseudocode:

define variable first_name
request user input ("Enter your name:")
assign user input to first_name
print(first_name + "Hello,World")

3.An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
returns their arithmetic average.

Proposed pseudocode:

initialise variable total_sum to zero
initialise variable count to zero 
request an integer from the user
if the input is not zero
	add user input to the total_sum
	increment count by one
if the input is zero
	exit the loop
calculate the arithmetic average (total_sum / count)
print arithmetic average

4.An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

Proposed pseudocode:

initialise an empty list called grocery_list
initialise an empty list called bought_list
ask the user to input the grocery list 
ask the user to input bought_items
determine which items are left to buy (remove all items in bought_list from grocery_list)
sort the remaning items in alphabetical order
print the new sorted grocery_list

5.An algorithm for the flowchart below:

Proposed pseudocode:

ask the user to input two numbers
assign first number to X and second number to Y ( X = number 1 and Y = number 2)
calculate S as X + Y
calculate A as S/2
calculate P as X * Y
Print(S, A, P)
